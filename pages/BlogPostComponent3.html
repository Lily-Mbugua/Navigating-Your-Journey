            <p> Colonialism is the direct and overall domination of one country by another on the basis of state power being in the hands of a foreign power. The first objective of colonialism is political domination. Its second objective is to make possible the exploitation of the colonized country. It is a phenomenon which is part and parcel of another phenomenon called imperialism. In fact, colonialism is a direct form of imperialism. This is why it is often said that” all colonialism is imperialism, but not all imperialism is colonialism” </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> Colonialism: We can all reach the general consensus that it was one of the most inhumane human acts of man kinds history. It’s extremely difficult to draw advantages from an act that was born out of tears, blood and pain. An event so catastrophic that it changed the course of the world and we still live in the ripple math of the damaged caused throughout the world especially in our home. Africa. The motherland, Treasure of the Earth. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> With this said, the human spirit, is crushed but never broken or destroyed. It’s unfortunate that it took a magnitude pain to reach here but like the phoenix, we rise and try again, coming back stronger and better than ever to finally be victors and emerge as the queens and kings we rightfully are. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p>Colonialism began as a result of changes in the mode of production in Europe (For example, the emergence of industrial revolution). The industrial revolution ushered in a new process of production in place of the earlier slave based economy. The industrial revolution was a revolutionary trend in the history of mankind. The problem of how to lubricate machineries came up with the emergence of the industrial revolution. The slave trade and slavery have by this time fulfilled their basic function of providing the primitive capital. The quest for the investment of the accumulated capital and the need for raw materials led to the colonization of Africa. This in itself is a paradox. On one hand, This was amazing for the British because it fueled their nations and made it the nation it is today, However this was a soul crushing life altering phenomenon that changed the trajectory of Africa and its people. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> Colonialism did not allow for industrialization of Africa. It assigned Africa the role of production of primary goods or raw materials in the international division of labour. Colonialism encouraged and intensified class struggle, tribalism and ethnicity within the African colonies. These were strategies introduced by the colonialists in order to perpetuate or prolong their rule and domination of African territories. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> Colonialism shaped both the economic and political structure of African colonies to be in line with the need of the metropolis. It ensured that African economic and political structures both in form and content serve the interest of their home government (European powers). Colonialism therefore, in all intents and purposes was adisservice to Africa. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p>  This may be an unpopular reason , As an African Woman, I do not think colonialism had any advantage, I wouldn’t call it an advantage because we paid for it in different ways. The cost of being “colonized”  outweigh any “advantage” we may have gained. We obviously picked up some things/ charcteristics from our collonisers but in doing so we lost part of our identity and culture. Nothing can be considered as an advantage if that was what it took to be colonized. </p>
