        <h1>Identity and Oppression: The Role of a Racist Nation in the Formation of the Black Feminine Psyche. </h1>

            <p>Self-determination is a birthright that many Black women have famously fought for and been denied but got denied. Black women more specifically black mothers, have done the work to challenge and change this narrative and replace it. The most prevalant way this tranaslates is in the way they raise their children.   </p>

            <p> Throughout the book 'Born a Crime', Patricia Noah, demonstrates this on how she rasies Trevor. A balance of tough love, discipline among other things but the most importantly: Freedom. Trevors' freedom was quite a paradox in itself. In one way, his 'freedom' was virtually non-existent, but his mother Patricia, allowed him to be him and did not supress his growth. She found a striking balance between discipline and with an iron fist while continously encouraging him to be his best self.</p>

            <p> Patricia's singlehood was quite rebelious. She truly did live her life and i'm glad Trevor described her as her own woman. Typically, when a woman is described, its always in relation to someone other than her: A wife, mother, sister, daughter. Never just an individual. Also she shared someof her rather risque experinces as a young woman. It was the 80's a rater conservative time in South Africa still is in some ways but Patricia decided she was going to live life her way and if it bothered you that was a you problem. American writers, Audre Lorde and Trisha R. Thomas, engage in a compelling argument for black feminine autonomy attained through a rejection of social constructs, which Lorde calls ‘external directives’ (Lorde 58). The experiences portrayed in the book, Born a Crime, mirror Lorde’s argument that, ‘external directives’ are antithetical to human needs and individuality. This media analysis serves to examine the ways in which Lorde’s refutations of patriarchal and rascist domination in the development of an erotic identity agree with and depart from Patricia Noah’s own journey towards a more liberated self-identification.</p>

            <p> The external source examined in this essay is a new addition to the literary world. Born a Crime is a fun and extremely intense book that challenged the 'Streotypes' as to what Africa was and our experiences. Finally proved in more ways than one that Blackness is not a monolith from Trevor Noahs’ similarly titled comedy special 'Bon a Crime'. The book tackles familiar narratives of romance and identity and reimagines black femininity as a conflicting abstract: one of disillusionment and triumph. </p>

            <p> Starting the analysis by drawing a parallel between the opening chapters and Trevor's own journey across the chapters of the book, Trevor comes full circle in his understanding of self. His transformation into self-awareness is connected through the symbolic power of comedy as a uniting element. The opening scene depicts a 5-year-old Trevor at the burial. He is the only biracial or 'white'- as many people refered to him as, at the funeral, an experience -however, as much as 'privillege'it comes across its quitet isolating in and of itself. Still an adventuresome toddler with curly hair and fair skin, not fully realized in the suppression of his identity, Trevor jumps defiantly into trouble and is met with ridicule by his neighbours. The scenes described in Soweto are imbued with many race-specific experiences. Most apparent to an academic analysis, is Trevor Noah’s family (except his mother) enforcing a rule of black patriarchal oppression through her instruction of respectability politics and an early development of double-consciousness (Higginbotham) (Bois). </p>

            <p> The outset of the book depicts a return to childlike joy. Trevor causing mischief and being stubborn and humorous tales of what his been up to with little regard to how dangerous other expectations held of him. unbothered by definitions of who he should be to contradict the reality of who she is.His journey back into his mind space represents the rediscovery of a deeply rooted sense of freedom.</p>

            <p> One can see how young black women like Patricia Noah descend into these identity crises. The policing of oneself is something young black children inherit through familial and social reprimanding and carry into adulthood. Something that she never fell 'victim to'. My perception is because she chose Trevor, she was mentally and emotionally prepared to raise a child, not only a child, but a biracial child at the height of Aparthied. During this point in time, I genuinely believe Patricia was the exception to the norm. Lorde speaks on this unfortunate inheritance developed from the school of patriarchal constraint, which is further influenced by white supremacist ideation. She elaborates on the ways in which the suppression of black women's erotic nature keeps them ‘docile’, ‘obedient’, and ‘externally defined’ (Lorde 58).</p>

            <p> Readers read Trevor Noah departs from and returns to happiness under her own terms. After identifying this parallel, it becomes important to provide some analysis for the bits in the middle. Namely, the ways in which an internalization of racism forces and keeps his true identity suppressed and isolated by others. </p>

            <p> In conclusion, I am in awe of how much Patricia Noah raised Trevor. It must have been no easy feat. All Trevor's success is parallel to how he was raised. While we may never know the 'What If's' in our life, I truly believe had it not been for Patricia, Trevor would not be where he is today.</p>
