            <p>  Sweet, Sweet quarantine. At first, I’m sure this was amazing news with for most young people.  Time to catch up on some rest, bonding with the family, sleeping in, finally catching up on a few Netflix shows you’ve been looking forward to watching. During this time we were able to read some good books without interruption. One thing that’s been evident is coronavirus is here and here to stay. This is the new normal and we need to get used to it and adjust. Now, reality has set its course. Your children are at home full time because the schools are all closed. You still need to get office work done, keep the kids occupied, entertained and play the part of school teacher. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p>  Now, reality is starting to kick in. Children are at home full time because schools are closed. Mainly rotting their brains with social media, YouTube, video games, you’re struggling to get work done, keep the youth / children occupied (in a productive manner). You’re probably going a little stir-crazy and developing cabin fever. You desperately want to go outside, but don’t want to catch the coronavirus and you certainly don't want to spread it to some else, especially if they’re older. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p>  It looks like we will be hibernating in seclusion for a while. Our officials say it's only temporary. Most likely two more months will turn into six months—or longer—depending on how quickly we can contain the outbreak but at this rate and how our government is containing the virus? I doubt it.  </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p>  You now have a critical choice to make: you can either waste away the moments that make up a dull day or use this time to your advantage. You can continue binge-watching television and munching on snacks or you could embark upon a campaign of self-improvement and helping others or better yet teach yourself that new skill, get on that diet, pray, do some yoga, everything you kept saying you don’t have time for? Now’s the time to do it. My advice is take a more challenging path and allocate your time toward productive and meaningful endeavors. First and foremost, one of the most important things one should have is a routine / learn how to manage your time. It’s too easy to let the hours, days and weeks fly by without doing anything constructive. Use this extra time as a gift to be proactive. Put together a schedule that incorporates all of the things that you want to accomplish and make sure you follow through on engaging in the activities. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p>  First things first, There’s nothing wrong with a little introspection. Take some quiet time to assess where you are in your life and career. Contemplate if you’re happy with who you are and what you’re doing. Be honest with yourself. There’s no benefit to pretending that everything is going great if it isn't. If you are not happy with your professional and personal life, start developing a strategy to achieve your goals. There’s this pressure out there, almost on all social media platforms. You have to do this, that, be a better individual. While there is a point to this and keep progressing as a human being, you need rest and getting yourself to a good place mentally. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p>  Maximizing your time to improve and help others is a wise decision. Instead of feeling helpless, sorry for yourself and complaining about the current state of affairs, you’ll gain control over your life. When it's all over, you’ll enjoy a great sense of accomplishment and appreciate that you didn’t squander precious weeks or months of your life.</p>
            <br> </br>
            <p>  If you are worried about the safety of your job—in light of the current mess we’re in—or were downsized, you can start an aggressive job search. Reach out to all of your contacts as they are stuck at home too and have no excuse for ignoring your requests for help. Put together a list of companies that you’d like to work for. Target internal corporate recruiters and folks who look like they’d be hiring managers and send out LinkedIn InMails and messages to them. Update your résumé, freshen up your LinkedIn profile, reach out to top recruiters in your space and practice your interviewing techniques. Interact on social media to build your brand and get noticed. </p>
            <br> </br>     
            <p>  Read up on new developments, digest industry-specific blogs, newsletters, articles and books.  </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p>  It's not just work-related stuff. Use this time wisely to lift yourself up intellectually. Download and read books that will help you gain more knowledge. If you don’t like reading and have a short attention span, there’s a wealth of great podcasts and YouTube videos that can help you with self-improvement, learning about new topics and staying abreast of fast-changing events.  </p>
